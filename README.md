# Phase 3 Project - Recipe Keeper

## General Overview

The Recipe Keeper allows its users to create, store, and navigate recipes stored within its database. With the Recipe Keeper users will only need to follow the easy to use CLI instructions to interact with the database that contains tables for the recipes themselves, the general ingredients, and the ingredients listed in the recipe. 

With the Recipe Keeper users will also be able to interact with their recipes in dynamic ways, these include adding new recipes, which includes insuring that duplicate recipes are not created, including an image URL of the recipe as well as the source URL. Users will also be able to update an existing recipe, delete a recipe, and search for a recipe.

Keeping recipes in bulky cookbooks are now a thing of the past with the Recipe Keeper!

## CLI Overview

The CLI file contains user instructions on how to interact with the Recipe Keeper app, these include instructions on how a user can add a recipe to the database. The user will need to include the recipe name, the prep-time, the instructions, how many servings the recipe creates, an image URL, a source URL, and the ingredients. Adding a recipe will also ensure that a duplicate recipe is not included in the database, that both the prep-time and servings are positive, that both URLs are valid, and the name or instructions are not empty spaces.

For updating a recipe the CLI instructions users on how to update any element of the existing recipe, while ensuring the previous requirements are still met. The CLI also instructs users on how to successfully delete a recipe that is no longer useful for them.

As for searching for a recipe, the CLI instructs the user how to search for a specific recipe by any of its attributes, including the ingredients.
